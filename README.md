# Draughts Project

This is the assignment for CCE2111 (Object Oriented Programming).

The main goal of this work is to create a text-based draughts game that runs in the command-line, using principles of object oriented programming and C++. The game is played in 2-player mode, with handling for multiple consecutive captures. The board state can be saved and loaded from a text file.
